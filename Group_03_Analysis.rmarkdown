# Introduction

# Data Cleaning




```{r}
# Read the data set
Data_FIES <- read.csv("C:/Users/7/Desktop/group 3/dataset03.csv")
# Tidy the data
FIES <- Data_FIES %>%
  # Place the dependent variable in the first column and delete the unique value
  select(Total.Number.of.Family.members, everything(), -Region) %>%
  # Convert categorical variables into factors
  mutate(
    Household.Head.Sex = as.factor(Household.Head.Sex),
    Type.of.Household = as.factor(Type.of.Household),
    Electricity = as.factor(Electricity)) %>%
  # Remove Missing Values
  drop_na()

```




# Exploratory Data Analysis




```{r}
str(FIES) # Check data structure 
summary(FIES) # Get summary statistics of all variables  
dim(FIES) # Check dataset dimensions (number of rows and columns)

```




## Numerical summaries and Data visualization

Now we can take a look at the numerical summaries and data visualization of dependent variable shown in the following tables and plots:




```{r}
#| label: tbl-y
#| tbl-cap: Summary statistics for 'Total.Number.of.Family.members'
#| tbl-cap-location: top

FIES |>
  summarize('Mean' = mean(Total.Number.of.Family.members),
            'Median' = median(Total.Number.of.Family.members),
            'St.Dev' = sd(Total.Number.of.Family.members),
            'Min' = min(Total.Number.of.Family.members),
            'Max' = max(Total.Number.of.Family.members),
            'IQR' = quantile(Total.Number.of.Family.members,0.75)-quantile(Total.Number.of.Family.members,0.25),
            'Sample_size' = n()
  ) |>
  gt() |>
  fmt_number(decimals=2) |>
  cols_label(
    Mean = html("Mean"),
    Median = html("Median"),
    St.Dev = html("Std. Dev"),
    Min = html("Minimum"),
    Max = html("Maximum"),
    IQR = html("Interquartile Range"),
    Sample_size = html("Sample Size")
  ) 

```

```{r}
#| label: fig-y
#| fig-cap: Histogram of 'Total.Number.of.Family.members'

# Visualize dependent variable distribution
ggplot(FIES, aes(x = Total.Number.of.Family.members)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 1, fill = "steelblue", color = "black") +
  labs(x = "Number of Family Members", y = "Frequency")

```




From @tbl-y, 

@fig-y shows that

Then check the variance of the dependent variable and compare with the mean:



```{r}
var <- var(FIES$Total.Number.of.Family.members)
var_ratio <- var/mean

```



var/mean=5.28/4.68=1.13��1 indicates that there is no overdispersion problem, so Poisson regression model may be appropriate.

Then we separate independent variables into categorical variables and numerical variables for analysis.

(1) Categorical Variables

From @tbl-y-household,

@fig-y-household shows that




```{r}

            'IQR' = quantile(Total.Number.of.Family.members,0.75)-quantile(Total.Number.of.Family.members,0.25),
            'Sample_size' = n(),

```{r}
#| label: fig-y-electricity
#| fig-cap: Boxplot of 'Total.Number.of.Family.members' by 'Electricity'

ggplot(FIES, aes(x = Electricity, y = Total.Number.of.Family.members, fill = Electricity)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(x = "Electricity (0 = No, 1 = Yes)", y = "Family Size") 

```




From @tbl-y-electricity, we can see households with electricity (1,630) are about six times more than those without (257). The mean values are nearly identical (4.70 vs. 4.67), but the median is slightly higher for households without electricity (5.00 vs. 4.00). The standard deviation is also slightly larger in the non-electric group (2.47 vs. 2.27), indicating a bit more variability. The maximum value is higher in the electricity group (16.00 vs. 12.00), suggesting a wider range. Both groups have the same interquartile range (3.00), meaning their middle 50% distributions are similar. These differences can be visualized more clearly with boxplots.

@fig-y-electricity shows that households without electricity tend to have a slightly larger median family size compared to those with electricity. However, the distributions of family sizes in both groups are quite similar. The spread of family sizes in both groups is also comparable, as indicated by the interquartile range. Additionally, both groups exhibit several outliers, representing families with unusually large sizes, as shown by the points beyond the ��whiskers�� of the boxplots.

(2) Numerical Variables




```{r}
#| label: fig-his-num
#| fig-cap: Histograms for Numerical Variables

p1 <- ggplot(FIES, aes(x = Total.Household.Income)) +
  geom_histogram(fill = "steelblue", color = "black", bins = 30) +
  labs(title = "Household Income Distribution", x = "Household Income", y = "Count")
p2 <- ggplot(FIES, aes(x = Total.Food.Expenditure)) +
  geom_histogram(fill = "steelblue", color = "black", bins = 30) +
  labs(title = "Household Expenditure Distribution", x = "Household Expenditure", y = "Count")
p3 <- ggplot(FIES, aes(x = Household.Head.Age)) +
  geom_histogram(fill = "steelblue", color = "black", bins = 30) +
  labs(title = "Household Head Age Distribution", x = "Household Head Age", y = "Count")
p4 <- ggplot(FIES, aes(x = House.Floor.Area)) +
  geom_histogram(fill = "steelblue", color = "black", bins = 30) +
  labs(title = "House Floor Area Distribution", x = "House Floor Area", y = "Count")
p5 <- ggplot(FIES, aes(x = House.Age)) +
  geom_histogram(fill = "steelblue", color = "black", bins = 30) +
  labs(title = "House Age Distribution", x = "House Age", y = "Count")
p6 <- ggplot(FIES, aes(x = Number.of.bedrooms)) +
  geom_histogram(fill = "steelblue", color = "black", bins = 30) +
  labs(title = "Number of bedrooms Distribution", x = "Number of bedrooms", y = "Count")
(p1 | p2 | p3) / (p4 | p5 | p6)
```




From @fig-his-num, we can see the distributions of household income and household expenditure exhibit a noticeable right skew, suggesting that applying a log transformation may be beneficial when fitting a Poisson model. This also indicates that most households have relatively low income, while a few have extremely high income, reflecting a significant income disparity within the population.  

The distribution of household head age is approximately normal, with most household heads falling within the 30-60 age range. This suggests that middle-aged individuals are the primary decision-makers in households.  

The distribution of house floor area is strongly right-skewed, with most houses having relatively small areas, while a few have significantly larger ones. The scarcity of large houses may be due to their higher costs.  

The distribution of house age exhibits a slight bimodal pattern, indicating the presence of two types of houses: newly built and older homes.  

The number of bedrooms is a discrete variable, with most houses having 2 or 3 bedrooms, while houses with 4 or more bedrooms are less common.




```{r}
# Convert 'House.Age' to categorical variable
FIES$House.Age.Group <- cut(FIES$House.Age, breaks=c(0,10,30,100), labels=c("New","Middle","Old"))

# Convert categorical variable into factor
FIES$House.Age.Group <- factor(FIES$House.Age.Group)

# Remove the 'House.Age' column
FIES <- FIES %>% select(-House.Age)

```

```{r}
# Convert 'Number.of.bedrooms' to categorical variable
FIES$Bedroom.Category <- cut(FIES$Number.of.bedrooms, 
                             breaks = c(0, 1, 3, 5, Inf), 
                             labels = c("Small", "Medium", "Large", "Luxury"),
                             right = TRUE)

# Convert categorical variable into factor
FIES$Bedroom.Category <- factor(FIES$Bedroom.Category)

# Remove the 'Number.of.bedrooms' column
FIES <- FIES %>% select(-Number.of.bedrooms)

```




Then we can use the heat map to check the correlation between numerical variables and dependent variable:



```{r}
#| label: fig-corr-num
#| fig-cap: Heat map for numerical variables by 'Total.Number.of.Family.members' 

# Select all numerical variables
numeric_vars <- FIES[, sapply(FIES, is.numeric)]
# Since our dependent variable is a count varaible, use Spearman method
cor_matrix <- cor(numeric_vars, method = "spearman")
# Plot the correlation heatmap
ggcorrplot(cor_matrix, type = "full", lab = TRUE, lab_size = 4, 
           colors = c("blue", "white", "orange"), outline.color = "black", 
           legend.title = "Correlation") +
  labs(title = "Correlation Matrix for Numeric Variables") +
  theme(
    axis.text.x = element_text(size = 9, angle = 45, vjust = 1, hjust = 1),
    axis.text.y = element_text(size = 9),
    legend.text = element_text(size = 14),
    legend.title = element_text(size = 16)
  )

```




Form @fig-corr-num, we can see income and expenditure are strongly correlated, reinforcing the expected relationship that higher-income households tend to spend more. Total.Number.ofFamily.members influences Total.Food.expenditure, but its impact on household income is weaker. Household.head.age has a minor effect on most other variables, with a slight negative correlation with family size. House.Floor.Area shows some correlation with income, but not significantly with household.head.age.


# Formal Data Analysis




```{r}
# Fit a Poisson regression model
poisson_model <- glm(Total.Number.of.Family.members ~ 
                       log(Total.Household.Income) +
                       log(Total.Food.Expenditure) +
                       Household.Head.Sex +
                       Household.Head.Age + 
                       Type.of.Household +
                       log(House.Floor.Area) +
                       Electricity +
                       House.Age.Group +
                       Bedroom.Category, 
                     family = poisson(link = "log"),
                     data = FIES)
summary(poisson_model)

```

```{r}
# Check the Relative Risk(RR)
exp(coef(poisson_model)) 
# For Poission Regression, coefficients represent log-relative risk, so convert them to RR

```

```{r}
#| label: fig-residual
# plot the Pearson and deviance residuals against the linear predictor
resp <- resid(poisson_model, type = "pearson")
resd <- resid(poisson_model, type = "deviance")
p1 <- ggplot(poisson_model, aes(sample = resp)) + geom_point(stat = "qq", color = "steelblue") +
  ylab("Pearson residuals")

p2 <- ggplot(poisson_model, aes(sample = resd)) + geom_point(stat = "qq", color = "steelblue") +
  ylab("Deviance residuals")

p3 <- ggplot(poisson_model, aes(x = predict(poisson_model, type="link"), y =resp))+
  geom_point(col = "steelblue") +
  ylab("Pearson residuals") + xlab("Linear predictor")

p4 <- ggplot(poisson_model, aes(x = predict(poisson_model, type="link"), y =resd))+
  geom_point(col = "steelblue") +
  ylab("Deviance residuals") + xlab("Linear predictor")

grid.arrange(p1, p2, p3, p4, nrow = 2)
```



From @fig-residual, we can see the Q-Q plot shows that the tails deviate from the straight line, indicating that the residual distribution may not be normal, suggesting the presence of heavy tails or a violation of model assumptions.  
The residuals vs. predicted values plot exhibits a funnel-shaped pattern, indicating heteroscedasticity, where the variance of the residuals increases as the predicted values grow.

# Conclusion
