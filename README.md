# DAS-Group-03
# Project Overview
This project analyzes the Philippines Family Income and Expenditure Survey (FIES) dataset to identify key household-related factors that influence the number of people in a household. We use Generalized Linear Models (GLM) with Poisson regression to determine which variables significantly impact household size.
# Dataset
• Name: Philippines Family Income and Expenditure Survey (FIES)
• File: dataset03.csv
• Variables:
 • Total.Number.of.Family.members – Number of people living in the house

 • House.Age – Age of the building (in years)
 • Number.of.bedrooms – Number of bedrooms in the house
 • Electricity – Does the house have electricity? (1=Yes, 0=No)
